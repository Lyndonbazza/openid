Playing around with OpenID.

The lightopenid file is a very modified version of lightopenid from <http://gitorious.org/lightopenid>

It's experimental/unstable. Not fully tested.

I like Mozilla Persona better but more sites still support OpenID since it's been integrated into a large number of SSO plugins.
